# When you use a variable in a function, it's local in scope to the function.
x = 12


def change_x():
    # This keyword allows you to modify a variable outside of the current scope
    global x
    x = 99


change_x()

# This prints 12. What do we have to modify in change_x() to get it to print 99?
print(x)


# This nested function has a similar problem.

def outer():
    y = [120]

    def inner():
        # This keyword is used to work with variables inside nested funtions
        nonlocal y
        y = 999

    inner()

    # This prints 120. What do we have to change in inner() to get it to print
    # 999?
    # Note: Google "python nested function scope".
    print(y)


outer()
